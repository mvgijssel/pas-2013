--- Tests ---
(See rulebook for more details.)

[.] 1.1 - RIPS (full)
    [.] Poster Session
        [.] Modify poster
        [.] Print poster at repro (!)
    [.] Enter door and approach registration desk
    [.] Introduction/registration behavior
    [.] Leave the room
        [.] Test emergency button
        [.] Navigate back to exit door

[.] 1.2 - Follow Me (at least ITP1)
    [.] ITP1: Get basic predator following working
        [.] Verification if person is actually in front of robot (?)
    [.] ITP1: Filter misclassifications by narrowing depth/angle focus 
    [.] ITP1: Investigate Paul's segmentizer; nopredatorsegment (?)
    [.] ITP1: Incooperate blobdetector (?)
    [.] ITP2: Enter/exit elavator behavior
    [.] ITP1/2/3: Panic mode; basic search behavior if person is lost after x seconds

[P] 1.3 - Clean Up (postponed, currently too risky)
    (Only worth investigating if navigation and object recognition works flawlessly.)

[.] 1.4 - Who Is Who (at least the intro + receiving order)
    [I] Receive guests (!)
    [.] Go to correct room 
        (Can be hard-coded I think if navigation is not working.)
    [P] Searching for calling person (too difficult, skip)
    [.] Receiving and repeating order
    [.] Navigating to pickup room (where the drinks are)
    [P] Grasping drinks (too difficult, skip)
    [I] Searching and recognizing guests
    [.] Option 1: Get all drinks and deliver them all at once (requires tray).
    [.] Option 2: Get and bring drinks one by one (time consuming?)
    [.] Make the robot move to the exit 30s (or so) before time limit expires (100 points)

[.] 1.5 - Technical Challenge
    (Not part of the main competition.)
    [.] Aproaching table
    [.] Activily searching for known objects 
    [.] Presenting found objects on screen 
    [P] Pointing to found object

[.] 1.6 - Open Challenge
    (Also see Demo Challenge and Finals, the teamleader during the demonstrations of OC.)
    [.] Prepare max. 2 slides
    [.] Prepare handouts for other teams
    [.] Prepare actual demo (similar to DC and Finals, but should be a bit different).

[.] 2.1 - GPSR
    (Category II seems to be the best option to take, go for cat I if it is too difficult.) 
    (See GPSR grammar and behavior in HG repo made by Bas.)
    [.] Good HRI (grammar, question/answer, repeating command etc.)
    [.] Navigating to correct room
    [.] Recognizing object and asking person to give it
    [.] Navigating back to the operator
    (?) Can we skip the grasping part?

[.] 2.2 - Restaurant
    [.] Guiding phase (simplified follow me)
    [.] Reaching locations
    [.] Asking operator to hand over object
    (?) Can we skip the grasping part?

[.] 2.3 - Demo Challenge
    (Also see Open Challenge and Finals.)
    [.] Prepare pitch (1 minute)
    [.] Prepare demo (depends on results of OC) 

[.] Finals
    (Also see Open Challenge and Demo Challenge.)
    [.] Option 1: GPSR including extra commands such as Follow Me etc.
    [.] Prepare demo (depends on results of OC and DC)
